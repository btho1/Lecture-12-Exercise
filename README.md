# Lecture-12-Exercise
# Jared and Brian's plan to pass INFO 201


Near the end of the week, Brian and Jared realize that they have to combine their skills in order to complete their **Lecture 12 Exercise**. They need to have _the ability to know how to create a repository_, _add collaborators_, _make changes to the README.md file, and push it all to GitHub_. With being able to do these tasks, they will be able to still be on track to pass their INFO 201 class.

For breakfast Jared ate rice and pork with milk.

# Our info 200 project summary
