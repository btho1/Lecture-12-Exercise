# Lecture-12-Exercise
# Jared and Brian's plan to pass INFO 201

Near the end of the week, Brian and Jared realize that they have to combine their skills in order to complete their **Lecture 12 Exercise**. They need to have _the ability to know how to create a repository_, _add collaborators_, _make changes to the README.md file, and push it all to GitHub_. With being able to do these tasks, they will be able to still be on track to pass their INFO 201 class.
